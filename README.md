__Abstract__
The last decade has witnessed a growing interest in video salient object detection (VSOD). However, the research community long-term lacked a well-established VSOD dataset representative of real dynamic scenes with high-quality annotations. To address this issue, we elaborately collected a visual-attention-consistent Densely Annotated VSOD (DAVSOD) dataset, which contains 226 videos with 23,938 frames that cover diverse realistic-scenes, objects, instances and motions. With corresponding real human eye-fixation data, we obtain precise ground-truths. This is the first work that explicitly emphasizes the challenge of saliency shift, i.e., the video salient object(s) may dynamically change. To further contribute the community a complete benchmark, we systematically assess 17 representative VSOD algorithms over seven existing VSOD datasets and our DAVSOD with totally ~84K frames (largest-scale). Utilizing three famous metrics, we then present a comprehensive and insightful performance analysis. Furthermore, we propose a baseline model. It is equipped with a saliencyshift-aware convLSTM, which can efficiently capture video saliency dynamics through learning human attention-shift behavior. Extensive experiments1 open up promising future directions for model development and comparison.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo into your computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DengPingFan/DAVSOD.git
```
2. Cd to `DAVSOD/mycaffe-convlstm`, follow the [official instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) to build caffe. We provide our make file `Makefile.config` in folder `DAVSOD/mycaffe-convlstm`.

The code has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 16.04 with CUDA 8.0 and OpenCV 3.1.0

3. Make 'caffe'
```
make all -j8
```

4. Make 'pycaffe'
```
make pycaffe
```

5. Download pretrained caffemodel from [my homepage](http://dpfan.net/DAVSOD) and extract the .zip file under the root directory `DAVSOD/model/`. 

6. Put the test image in `DAVSOD/Datasets/` and run `generateTestList.py` to get the test list. Then run `SSAV_test.py` to get the saliency maps. 
The results will be saved in `DAVSOD/results/SSAV/`. You can also evaluate the model performance (S-measure[1], E-measure[2], F-measure and MAE) 
using our matlab code `main.m` in `DAVSOD/EvaluateTool/` directory.
